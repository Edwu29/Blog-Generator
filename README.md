# Blog-Generator
_An educational web-page created by the poggies team! :)_ 

## Description
With little experience in web development, we did our best to create an educational tool that allows users to log in and create helpful posts based on specific topics. With links attached to each post, viewers of the web-page can easily use the filters to navigate and find relevant information.

This is the Home Page from our Figma mockup! As you can see, users have the option of **logging in** or **creating an account**. From there, they can **add a post**. For each post, they must input a *title, description, links, and relevant tags*. This information is then displayed in a card, where viewers can either upvote or share the post! We also wanted to include the ability to **search** and **filter** to make it more streamlined for viewers.

Users can click on filters to open up these provided options and apply them to their search.

If you want to interact with our Figma [mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/1zYmyqPG7HetwuxPjbhyR3/HackDuke-thingie?node-id=2%3A1&scaling=min-zoom), here it is!

## Future Scope
- Implementing Log In and Creating Account Functionality
- Applying Filters to the Search
- Saving previous tags to tailor recommendations
